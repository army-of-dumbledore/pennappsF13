Pollio
======

Pollio is a social polling app for Android phones. Its development was jump-started over a weekend at the PennApps Fall 2013 hackathon at the University of Pennsylvania. Pollio's team was Dumbledore's Army, consisting of Joe Trovato, Alex Burka, Ellie Pavlick and Alex Salz.

The app consists of a server component (in the `django` directory) and an Android app (in the `eclipse` directory, compiled as `pollio.apk`). Here is a video demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nlp1XQ0PVI
